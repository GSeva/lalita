There's no install. You just run the bot from the directory where you get it.
Just a couple of things:

 * Depends on twisted (more specificaly, twisted words) and python-pysqlite2.

 * url.Url plugin depends on Beautiful Soup v3.1.0.1 or similar (just check that
   XHTML_ENTITIES exist), python-magic and python-chardet (and twisted web, just
   in case you installed a partial twisted).
