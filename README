Rename config.py.examples to config.py and run ircbot.py

There're a lot of test cases! You can try them running "nosetests" (you 
need to have Nose installed).

To create a plugin, check the plugins/example.py one, and use it as a start.

-------
Manhole
-------
The --manhole[-*] options enable a manhole ssh server the provides an interactive
interpreter to poke the bot instance(s).
Example:
$> python ircbot.py --manhole &  
$> ssh admin@localhost -p 2222
admin@localhost's password: admin
# this will drop you in a python shell
>>> bot = servers['<server name>']
# bot is a IrcBot instance
>>> bot.say('<channel>', 'something')
